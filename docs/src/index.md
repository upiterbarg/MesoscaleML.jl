# MesoscaleML.jl

In this project, we look to use **machine learning** methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop a robust parameterization for baroclinic instability in **mesoscale** flows, evaluating our resultant models against the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations.

We use the mean-field approximation to 2-layer QG model as the initial base of our parameterization procedure.
