# MesoscaleML.jl

In this project, we look to use **machine learning** methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop a robust parameterization of the 2-layer **quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations** for planetary flows, focusing specifically on **baroclinic instability** in **mesoscale** flow. 

As a starting point, we use the *mean-field approximation* to 2-layer QG model as our base in our parameterization procedure.

**Documentation is incoming!**
