# MesoscaleML.jl

In this project, we look to use **machine learning** methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop a robust parameterization of the 2-layer **quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations** for planetary flows, focusing specifically on baroclinic instability in mesoscale flow. As a starting point, we will begin by with the *mean-field approximation* to 2-layer QG model.

Documentation is incoming!
