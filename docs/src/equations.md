# Introduction

In 1963, [J.R. Herring applied the "mean field theory" parameterization approach to convection](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1963/1963_Herring_1.pdf), deriving a relatively simple set of equations which performed well empirically at large Rayleigh numbers (i.e. for turbulent convective flows).

We can apply this parameterization approach to baroclinic instability (significant in the ocean and an important driver of large-scale eddy transport in the mid-latitude atmosphere) via the 2-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations.
